      <p class="section-content" id="section-content-1">
        We're excited to bring back our Women's Self-Defence Workshop — with a new focus! In our previous session, we covered prevention, creating distance, and seeking safety. This time, we’re diving into what happens when connection is already made.<br><br>

        Learn the most effective Judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques to control, immobilize, and neutralize an aggressor until help arrives. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced athlete, our skilled instructors will work with you to develop confidence and calm under pressure.<br><br>

        Our goal is to create a safe, supportive, and inclusive environment where you can feel empowered and strong — without promoting aggression or violence. Join us in learning how to take control when it matters most.

        <p>Please note that our program is not a guarantee of safety. While we teach self-defence techniques, situations can vary, and participants should use their judgment in real-life situations. Our goal is to empower women with skills and confidence, but ultimate safety relies on various factors.</p>
