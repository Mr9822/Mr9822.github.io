  <h1>Maxime Raymond</h1>
  <p>Looking to take your martial arts skills to the next level? Look no further than Restigouche Dojo! Our accomplished instructor, Maxime Raymond, brings over 15 years of experience on the provincial team of Judo New Brunswick, as well as extensive training at the National Training Centre in Montreal where he had the privilege of training with Olympic athletes and honing his Judo skills to an elite level.</p>
  <p>Maxime's achievements include winning multiple international medals, representing Canada at the Francophone Games in Nice, France, and Near East, Lebanon, and being a member of the Pan-Am National Team in the Republic of El Salvador. He has also won the President Pitney Bowes Sports NB Sports Award and was named Best Overall Canadian Athlete by Judo Canada in 2007.</p>
  <p>Maxime's skillset extends beyond Judo, as he has had the privilege of training in the birthplace of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), Brazil, on multiple occasions. While he trained in BJJ for several years under the guidance of Rodrigo Resende, a 5th-degree black belt in both Judo and BJJ, Maxime also trained at local clubs in Brazil, where he had the opportunity to experience different training styles and techniques. This extensive training with elite martial artists, both with Rodrigo and in Brazil, has provided him with an in-depth understanding of various martial arts disciplines. Maxime is passionate about sharing his knowledge with his students at Restigouche Dojo, and his well-rounded skillset makes him a versatile and valuable martial artist.</p>
